15/05/2017 10:50:20,DEFINICIÓN,What is service design?,"El diseño de servicios es una disciplina en estudio, por lo que no existe una sóla definición universal. Sin embargo, a grandes rasgos podemos decir que es una metodología del diseño, donde el enfoque está puesto en el usuario de una manera multidisciplinar, pues combina conocimientos y herramientas de varias disciplinas diferentes.","Most design disciplines draw from other areas and fields. Technology, cognitive science and aesthetics all contribute to design as we know it today. Service design, a more recent application of design expertise, is no different. Service design draws on many concepts, ranging from user experience, marketing and project management in order to optimize new services. Service design was first introduced as a design discipline at the Köln International School of Design in 1991. As a new field, the definition of service design is evolving in academia.  But in practice, service design is: The activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between service provider and customers. The purpose of service design methodologies is to design according to the needs of customers or participants, so that the service is user-friendly, competitive and relevant to the customers.","Meghan Lazier.

15/05/2017 10:52:40,PRINCIPIOS,Five principles of service design thinking,"Según el libro ""This is service design thinking"" se definen 5 principios universales para entender el diseño de servicios, los cuales son: ser centrado en el usuario (o ver desde los ojos del consumidor), ser co-creativo (como la colaboración de varias disciplinas), ser secuencial (como una serie de acciones con lugar y tiempo definido), ser evidencial (que posee objetos físicos y tangibles que lo validan), y ser holístico (toma todos los aspectos de los procesos).","1. USER-CENTRED Services should be experienced through the customer's eyes. 2.CO-CREATIVE All stakeholders should be included in the service design process. 3. SEQUENCING The service should be visualised as a sequence of interrelated actions. 4. EVIDENCING Intangible services should be visualised in terms of physical artefacts. 4. HOLISTIC The entire environment of a service should be considered. A dynamic language for a dynamic approach Since there is no common definition of service design, this book instead outlines the way of thinking required to design services.","Marc Stickdorn. (2011).

15/05/2017 11:18:23,HERRAMIENTAS,Service design tools,"Dentro del diseño de servicios se manejan varias herramientas para proyectar la visión del usuario, los más conocidos son el ""Customer journal"" y el ""Service Blueprint"" los cuales permiten proyectar de manera didáctica la experiencia del usuario, al mismo tiempo que los procesos internos para generar esta experiencia, en este post se pone a disposición una página creada por un proyecto de título que reune varias herramientas útiles para el diseño de servicios.","This website is the result of the research activity done by Roberta Tassi during her graduation thesis, further developed within the framework of the cooperation between  DensityDesign research group at INDACO Department - Politecnico di Milano and DARC - the Research & Consulting Center of Domus Academy. Service Design Tools is conceived as an open platform of knowledge, to be shared with the design research community. The thesis work was named ""Design della comunicazione e design dei servizi. Il progetto della comunicazione per la fase di implementazione"" (Communication Design and Service Design. Implementing services through communication artifacts) with Paolo Ciuccarelli -Politecnico di Milano- Elena Pacenti and Chiara Diana -DARC, Domus Academy- as supervisors, in October 2008. The initial purpose was an investigation about the relation between communication design and service design, starting from the observation of the existing practices in the field of service design. The critical points and the opportunities concerning the use of communication tools during a service design process also emerged.","Roberta Tassi. (2009).

15/05/2017 11:18:27,DISEÑO GRÁFICO,Graphic designer: Providing a visual explanation,"El rol del diseño gráfico en el diseño de servicios se define como la explicación visual del servicio, entendiendose este como la ""interfaz"" entre el usuario y el proceso ejecutado desde el diseño de servicio, en ""This is service design thinking"" se traduce esto en dos ""objetos tangibles"" que serían ""information & branding"".","It is nearly impossible for any product or service to be available on the market without a graphically designed element. Wayfinding systems, user interfaces, pictograms, packaging, forms or manuals are all graphically designed. To be successful, these offerings have to be well designed and thought through in terms of their graphical impact and how the information they contain is structured. An individual’s perception of the world is much more dependent on visual impulses than ever before. At the same time, people have to deal with a plethora of sources of information, increasingly distributed by digital media. It is therefore necessary to develop mental filter systems, or mechanisms of perception through which individuals can continue to make sound decisions about the information and perceptual stimuli presented to them. Mental models help an individual’s orientation in the world; they are the abstract and reductive mental representation of the complexity all of us face in everyday life – the schemas by which all of us understand the world around ourselves. If, however, a user is confronted with a situation they have never previously experienced, they cannot fall back on an existing model. Knowledge about the payment process at a supermarket, and the mental model of how this system works in their head might or might not necessarily be helpful for understanding how to interact with a new online shopping process. The metaphor of the online shopping cart for example, promotes the development of a new mental model, through reference to an analogous experience. The individual can draw upon known mechanisms and functionalities associated with, in this case, shopping carts to understand a novel and largely intangible online system of payment. Even though online shopping is phenomenologically different from previous experiences the user might have of “offline” shopping. It is the graphic designer’s task to trigger an individual’s apriori mental models, or at least to positively influence the accrual of such cognitive representations of meaning. It is thus the graphic designer’s task to trigger an individual’s a priori mental models, or at least to positively influence the accrual of such cognitive representations of meaning. This chapter explains what graphic design is capable of and what role it can play within service design – from the perspective of a graphic designer","Jakob Stickdorn. (2011).

15/05/2017 11:19:30,PROYECTOS,The Best Service Designs of the Year,"Core77 es una plataforma para compartir proyectos de diseño, y ejecutan ""awards"" anuales de diferentes categorías de diseño, entre ellas podemos encontrar ""service design"" que presenta todo tipo de proyectos realizados a partir del diseño de servicios.","It doesn't take designing an entire ecosystem to make an impact in the world of service design—singling out individual issues can be more manageable and realistic than attempting tackling an entire industry or product category at once. And each of the honorees in the Service category of this year's Core77 Design Awards prove it. From efforts to help women better understand their financial systems to a punchcard for ordering pizza, the projects illustrate the breadth and depth of service design. Professional Winner: The damda, by M&MFacing our mortality as humans is practically inconceivable, not to mention something that not many people voluntarily likes to discuss. The damda, designed by M&M, is a toolkit  for those facing their own or a family member's death, enabling the user to better cope with his or her loss and live out the rest of their days in a meaningful manner. The kit  itself consists of tools that will help the user record their past and present activities—a printer, paper and a compact note scanner. The jury called the work ""to cry for."" They continue: ""The designer brilliantly spotted a delicate time span in people's lives that is priceless and designed a service to make sure it can be experienced as it should be. Great empathetic eye.""","Core77 Design Awards. (2014).
